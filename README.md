# cmac_coding_ml

This is the course given to the CMAC PhD students to give them an introduction to Python and also machine learning. The course materials are as follows:

* There are 3 IPython notebooks (.ipynb files), the order in which to work through them is: `intro_to_python`, `data_analysis` and `machine_learning`.
* The solutes directory contains the dataset used throughout the exercises to explore, combine and perform machine learning on a dataset containing varying solvents, solutes and their molecular descriptors. The main idea being the ability to predict solubility of a solute in a solvent from the molecular descriptors.
* The presentations directory contains the slides presented at the course.
* The solutions directory contains the solutions (well *my* solutions, coding structure varies per person) to the exercises presented in the three notebooks.

This course was designed for anyone who has never used Python before and is unfamiliar with ML.
