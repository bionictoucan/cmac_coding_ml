    "## Exercise 1: `range`\n",
    "\n",
    "This first exercise will demonstrate the usage of the built-in Python function `range`. `range` is useful for generating iterators of numbers which can be used in for loops. The syntax for `range` is as follows: `range(start, stop, step)` where \n",
    "\n",
    "* start is the number to start at,\n",
    "* stop is the number to stop at + 1 and\n",
    "* step is how to count between the two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. `range(1, 4, 1)` will return a range object (not quite a list as we'll see below) starting at 1, ending at 3 and incrementing the number 1 at a time &mdash; essentially providing the number 1, 2, 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `range` can be used without the step e.g. `range(1,4)` where the code will assume that the step is 1\n",
    "* if a start number is not provided to `range` then the range will start from zero e.g. `range(4)` provides the numbers 0 to 3.\n",

    "## Exercise 2: `enumerate`\n",
    "\n",
    "Another very useful built-in function in Python is `enumerate`. This can be thought of as combining the `range` function and a list we wish to loop over. Consider a case where you need access to the items in a list but also the order at which they are in the list &mdash; this is where `enumerate` comes in handy. The syntax is as follows\n",

Then when implementing in a `for` loop, rather than just extracting the items in the list one at a time, the enumerate will give the user access to the item from the list **and** the order with which it is in the list.\n",
